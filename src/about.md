**I know how important it is to have a reliable machine, because a mechanical failure can ruin a ride or a trip.**

That’s why I made my first bicycle frame in 2007. I wanted something I could trust during a 5-week trip around Iceland.

I believe steel is the ideal material for a bicycle: strong, durable, easy to work with, a joy to ride, and, frankly, beautiful. There’s just something about those skinny tubes that makes me smile.

**My goal is to build steel bicycles that are dependable, fun, and tailored to your adventures.**

Whether you're after a racy gravel bike [like the Whippet](/bikes/whippet), a fun-loving hardtail [like the Manifesto](/bikes/manifesto), or a [one-of-a-kind custom build](/bikes/custom), I promise to deliver you a bicycle you can count on ride after ride.
