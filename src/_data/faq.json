        "q": "What is the warranty?",
        "a": "<p>I use only the best tubing and raw materials for making your frame, and I stand by my work. If you are the original owner, Manzanita Cycles offers a lifetime warranty on all Manzanita-made products that fail due to a materials or manufacturing defect.</p><p>If you crash, abuse, modify, or damage your Manzanita product, or if you install parts incorrectly, use incompatible parts, or fail to do proper maintenance on your bike, then it will no longer be covered by the warranty. Any paint and graphics are also not covered.</p><p>If you have a problem with a component not made by Manzanita Cycles, it's best to contact the component manufacturer for support. However, if you're having trouble getting traction, let me know and I'll try to help out.</p>"

    {
        "q": "Is shipping included in the price?",
        "a": "<p>I typically use UPS to ship your bike with insurance to cover its replacement in case of theft or damage. Shipping to a US destination starts at <strong>$75</strong> for a frameset. Complete bikes will be more.</p><p>I'm also happy to ship to international destinations. But please note that shipping fees, import fees, and import taxes can get very expensive.</p><p>You can also pick up the bike from Manzanita Cycles World Headquarters if you live near Reno.</p>"
